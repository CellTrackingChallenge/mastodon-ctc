This folder contains implementation of technical, biomedical and dataset measures
that were used in the paper [Ulman et al. An objective comparison of cell-tracking algorithms. Nature Methods. 2017.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4473).
That is, implementation of measures that allow to evaluate & benchmark [cell tracking](http://www.celltrackingchallenge.net/).
